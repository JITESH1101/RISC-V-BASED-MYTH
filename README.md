# RISC-V-BASED-MYTH
This repository contains my implementation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU, built from the ground up using TL-Verilog. This project was the culmination of my learning in the RISC-V MYTH Workshop, conducted by VLSI System Design (VSD) and Redwood EDA.
# INTRODUCTION
RISC-V ISA: A thorough understanding of the RISC-V instruction set and its design philosophy.

Software Development: Writing, compiling, and debugging C and Assembly programs for a RISC-V target.

Simulation & Verification: Using industry-standard tools like Spike to simulate program execution and objdump to analyze binary files.

Digital Design with TL-Verilog: Mastering Transaction-Level Verilog on the MakerChip IDE to describe complex hardware behavior efficiently.

CPU Microarchitecture: Designing and integrating essential CPU components, including:
 
 -> Register File
 
 ->Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
 
 ->Control Logic
 
 ->A complete 5-Stage Pipeline
